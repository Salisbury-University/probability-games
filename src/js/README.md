## JS Folder

The `js` folder contains the original JavaScript files. You can find various JS files used for the games.

## Min Folder

The `min` folder contains the minified versions of the JS files. Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters, comments, and whitespace from the JS code, resulting in smaller file sizes. The minified files have the same names as their corresponding original JS files but with the `.min.js` extension.

Minified JS files are often used in production environments to optimize website performance by reducing file size and improving page load times.

## Usage

To use the minified JS files in your project, you can simply include them in your HTML files like this:

```html
<script src="min/script1.min.js"></script>
<script src="min/script2.min.js"></script>
<!-- Add more script tags for other minified JS files -->
